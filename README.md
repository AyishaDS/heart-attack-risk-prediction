## 🎯 Steps:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Outlier Analysis**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Encoding**
- **Standardization**
- **Modeling & Hyperparameter Optimization**
- **Feature Importance Analysis**

## 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset includes a diverse set of variables:

- **Medical metrics**: cholesterol levels, blood pressure, triglycerides, heart rate, previous cardiovascular diseases
- **Lifestyle indicators**: smoking, alcohol use, diet, physical activity, stress level
- **Socioeconomic status**: income, education level, employment
- **Geographical distribution**: regional/country-based data

---

## 🧠 Modeling Approach

- Applied several **supervised machine learning models**
- Tuned hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** 

---

## 🔍 Feature Importance

At the final stage, a **feature importance analysis** was conducted to identify the most influential factors affecting heart attack risk. Key features included:
- BMI
- Triglycerides
- Exercise Hours Per Week
- Cholesterol level
- Income


These insights can help prioritize health interventions and public health policies.
